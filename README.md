# <p align="center"> **CHS Schedule Generator** </p>
This program is made to assist CHS students creating a schedule. It displays all possible valid
schedules of their desired courses, allowing them to select the one that suits them best.

It takes care of several special cases like courses where both lectures and tutorials need to be of 
the same group number, if you encouter problem please let me know.

The program is adjutsed to the new course codes for fall 2023.

It can also be adjusted to eliminate slots that are currently closed.

For the current version it is just a console application, I plan to make a user-friendly 
GUI in the future.

To see the tutorial videos make sure you are using the desktop browser.

## **Section 1: How to use**
1- Open the given project

2- Install Pandas and Openpyxl

3- enter the course codes in the given format: code1,code2,code3, for instance: cmpn321,genn004
, notice it is not case sensitive.

4- press enter, then an excel file called output will be generated (or adjusted if you used the program before)

The previous example was made on one of my test input files, generated schedules are surely more, it also used,
old course codes but that is something that has been adjusted.




## **Section 2: Adjusting input**

The default input file assumes all course slots are available, this is the case before the registeration begins,
However in the unfortunate case of not being able to register your original desired schedule, using the program 
would result in invalid output, thus you need to alter the input file as shown.
To do the next steps you need to be using Microsoft Edge browser.

Surely it is better to delete all the contents of the Input file the paste the new content.
